class Solution:
    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        count = 0  # Start counting odds from 0
        for num in range(low, high + 1):  # Loop from low to high (inclusive)
            if num % 2 == 1:               # Check if the number is odd
                count += 1                 # If odd, add 1 to count
        return count                      # Return the total count of odd numbers

#Step-by-step example:
#Say low = 3, high = 7
#Loop runs for numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
#Check each:
#3 % 2 = 1 (odd) → count = 1
#4 % 2 = 0 (even) → count stays 1
#5 % 2 = 1 (odd) → count = 2
#6 % 2 = 0 (even) → count stays 2
#7 % 2 = 1 (odd) → count = 3
#End of loop, count = 3
#Return 3
