class Solution:
    def addDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
#A single-digit number (0 to 9) is already the final result, so we don't need to process it.
#Any number greater than or equal to 10 has at least two digits (e.g., 10, 38, 123).
        while num >= 10:
            num = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))
        return num
#If num = 38, the steps are:
#Convert 38 to "38".
#Iterate through the digits: "3" and "8".
#Convert them back to integers: 3 and 8.
#Sum them: 3 + 8 = 11.
#The loop repeats with num = 11.
#Next iteration: 1 + 1 = 2.
#Now num = 2, which is a single digit, so the loop stops.
